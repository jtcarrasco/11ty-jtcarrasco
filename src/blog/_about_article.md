![Jason Carrasco](/assets/_img/jtc.jpg) Currently, Iâ€™m the Production Operations Director at [edlio](https://www.edlio.com) mainly working on internal projects for my organization. I jump around from working with a front end languages (HTML | JS | CSS) to working with [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) creating and optimizing assets, logos, and UI kits for our teams. Every day is a new challenge, and requires a lot of different tools. If your interested is seeing what's in my toolbox take a look at my [uses ](/uses) page.

I've become an expert ["arm cat"](/assets/_img/catarm.jpg) typist, just one of my many talents.  For funsies I've been doing what I call "coffee design" at [cottonbureau](https://cottonbureau.com) as [@daemon_cat](https://cottonbureau.com/people/daemon-cat).  And Like everyone, I have some favorite corners of the [interwebs](https://youtu.be/U_o8gerare0) here are just a few of those [places](/likes) I like to visit.
