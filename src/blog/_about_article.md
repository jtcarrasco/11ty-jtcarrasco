![Jason Carrasco](/assets/_img/jtc.jpg) Hi, I'm a designer and developer for hire; you could say I'm a "jack of all trades" kind of guy, as I'm reasonably proficient in visual design and coding languages. I welcome new challenges that push me to learn new things, explore different avenues, and require me to pick up various tools to get the job done. If you're interested in seeing what's in my toolbox, take a look at my [uses page](/uses).

I've become an expert ["arm cat"](/assets/_img/catarm.jpg) typist, just one of my many talents. And Like everyone, I have some favorite corners of the [interwebs](https://youtu.be/U_o8gerare0); here are just a few of those [places](/likes) I like to visit.
