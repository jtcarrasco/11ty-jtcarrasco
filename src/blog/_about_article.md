![Jason Carrasco](/assets/_img/jtc.jpg) Currently, Iâ€™m the Production Coordinator at [edlio](https://www.edlio.com) mainly working on internal projects for my organization. I jump around from working with a front end languages (HTML | JS | CSS) to working with [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) creating and optimizing assets, logos, and UI kits for our teams. Every day is a new challenge, and requires a lot of different tools. If you're interested in seeing what's in my toolbox take a look at my [uses ](/uses) page.
