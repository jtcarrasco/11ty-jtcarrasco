![Jason Carrasco](/assets/_img/jtc.jpg) Hi, I'm a designer and developer for hire; you could say I'm a "jack of all trades" kind of guy, as I'm reasonably proficient in visual design and coding languages. I welcome new challenges that push me to learn new things, explore different avenues, and require me to pick up various tools to get the job done.
