I made a website! It's a long time coming but I finally got around to finishing it. With the ever changing substack of dev life I finally decided on [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and [netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/) cms to run this deal.  I'd like to give kudos to [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) for putting together a great tutorial found [here](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g). Also to [Nikita Zanella](https://github.com/NikitaZanella/11ty-SASS) for the starter files.

This is definitely ver 1.0 as I have a list of stuff I'd like to clean up but it's out there and live so that's what's important amirite?
