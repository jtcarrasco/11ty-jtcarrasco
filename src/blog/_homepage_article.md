I am a Designer and Developer (at least I play one on the Internet) from Southern California. I am currently walking the earth, looking for new and exciting professional opportunities. I enjoy [sammiches](https://www.instagram.com/salt_hank/?hl=en), [keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/), [vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/user/jtcarrasco), and playing ["coyote guy"](https://youtu.be/K4MhCvraJeE) with my Kiddo.
